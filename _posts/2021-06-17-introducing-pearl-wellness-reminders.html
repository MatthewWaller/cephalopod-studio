<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://t.co/pUY5TiPUUi?amp=1">This app</a> started in the middle of the pandemic. I wanted to remember something good. And something true.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I came up with Pearl: reminders created by the person using the app. You set the time frame when you want the reminders to appear. And they show up at a random time within that period. And the app gives suggestions, or prompts, for writing meaningful notifications.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I knew I wasn’t going to make a replacement for therapy or a long talk with a friend. I wouldn’t try to sustain mental health with a randomized notification system. I’m bipolar myself, and know the world isn’t that simple.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In fact, I wasn’t sure I did want the app until I used it for a while. The cynic in me thought, ah, great, nothing like unnecessary notifications to make you stare into your screen for the sake of well being.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And yet I wanted to be interrupted, with spontaneity, with a bit of whimsy, with reminders of what I knew to be most valuable. I know what’s important in life. It’s just hard to remember it sometimes.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I made this for me, and I wanted to make it as nice as possible. That’s why it’s coming out now rather than last fall or winter.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I didn’t want the process of making a wellness app to burn me out. So I spent WAY too long going through all kinds of designs. Waterfalls grids, and mosaics and flippy cards. Half a dozen kinds of animations. Just playing with things, seeing what I could do. Even after I got to the basic flow and feature set, I got more help refining that design even further!</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I worked on the little things. For instance, an ellipses in the prompts marks a natural place where people can personalize the suggestion. When the card pops up, I didn’t want the user to need to tap on the text, so the keyboard and selection appears for them. And when there is an ellipses, I didn’t want the user to need to go through the trouble to select the ellipses, so I do that for them. Little interactions like that.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then I made it as nice as I could on iPad, and on the Mac, so that Pearl would feel at home in those environments, not just as a copy-paste of the iPhone design.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I also wanted first-class accessibility. So there are controls for VoiceOver, and I made sure the app still looked good and worked well with even the biggest dynamic text sizes someone can pick in their accessibility settings. I aimed to respect reduced motion and reduced transparency settings, and got help to get a good color scheme for colorblind folks (I’m red-green colorblind myself).</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And of course I added widgets, and custom icons, because those are awesome.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Even with all my work there are still bugs (at least one, swipy text isn’t behaving well, dang it), but I’ll work those out.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here it is. I hope you find as much value in Pearl as I have. And I wish you well-being no matter your situation.</p>
